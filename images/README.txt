Expected image file names used by the website:
- bouquet.jpg   (used on bouquet page)
- photo1.jpg    (top-left memory frame)
- photo2.jpg    (top-right memory frame)
- photo3.jpg    (bottom-left memory frame)
- photo4.jpg    (bottom-right memory frame)

Optional:
- voice-message.mp3 (you can upload this manually from the final page)

Tips:
- Keep image sizes reasonable for faster loading (for example ~1200px wide).
- You can use .png or .webp too, just update file extensions in HTML.
